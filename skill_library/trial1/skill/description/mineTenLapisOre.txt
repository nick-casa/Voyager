async function mineTenLapisOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 10 lapis ore blocks using a stone pickaxe or better. If the bot does not have a stone pickaxe or better, it will craft one using the available resources in the inventory. Once the pickaxe is available, it will equip it and use the exploreUntil function to find 10 lapis ore blocks. If enough lapis ore blocks are found, it will mine them using the mineBlock function. Finally, it will check the inventory to ensure that it has at least 10 lapis lazuli.
