async function craftStoneArmor(bot) {
    // The function crafts stone armor for the bot if the version of Minecraft has stone armor and the bot has the recipe and materials for crafting it. It first checks if the version of Minecraft has stone armor and if the bot has the recipe for crafting a stone chestplate, stone leggings, and stone boots. If the bot has the recipe, it checks if it has the required materials for crafting the items, and if not, it mines cobblestone. It then places a crafting table near the bot and crafts the items using the crafting table. Finally, it equips the stone chestplate, stone leggings, and stone boots and sends a chat message.
