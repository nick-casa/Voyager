async function mineFourOakLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 4 oak logs. It explores the environment until it finds 4 oak log blocks within a certain distance. If enough oak logs are found, it mines the 4 oak log blocks. After mining, it checks the inventory to ensure that the bot has a total of 5 oak logs. If the inventory contains 5 oak logs, it indicates that the mining was successful. Otherwise, it indicates that the mining failed.
