async function mineFiveIronOres(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 iron ores using a stone pickaxe. If the bot does not have a stone pickaxe, it will check if there are enough cobblestones and sticks to craft one. If not, it will mine cobblestones and craft sticks. If there is no crafting table in the inventory, it will craft one and place it in a suitable position. Then, it will craft a stone pickaxe using the crafting table. After equipping the stone pickaxe, it will find 5 iron ore blocks within a certain distance. If it cannot find enough iron ores, it will explore until it finds 5 iron ores. Finally, it will mine the 5 iron ore blocks.
