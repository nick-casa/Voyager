async function craftStoneHoe(bot) {
    // The function crafts a stone hoe using cobblestones and sticks. It checks if there are enough cobblestones and sticks in the inventory, and if not, it mines cobblestones or crafts sticks. Then, it places a crafting table near the bot and uses it to craft a stone hoe. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that a stone hoe has been crafted.
